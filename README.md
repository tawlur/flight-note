### What is Spot GPS

SPOT GPS transmitters gives you a critical, life-saving line of communication when you travel beyond the boundaries of cell service. SPOT Gen3 lets family and friends know youâ€™re okay, or if the worst should happen, sends emergency responders your GPS location - all with the push of a button. Add this rugged, pocket-sized device to your essential gear and stay connected wherever you roam.

### Why this app?

Not only does a GPS tranmitter provide the ability to reach out to emergency services, it gives user the ability to see the carriers location in real time. I saw a need to provide that information in a format that would be easilly shared, as well as important data necessry for unusual circumstances.

I was plesed to see that an api is availible for free to each individual device owner.
